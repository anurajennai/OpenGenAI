# OpenGenAI Datasets Charter - DRAFT

## Introduction 

The construction and facilitation of datasets instrumental to the foundational architecture of an Open Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) framework for India are of paramount importance. 
These datasets are characterized by their extensive diversity, encompassing a wide array of languages and vernacular expressions across multiple modalities, including audio, video, and text. 
This text outlines the methodologies and strategic frameworks employed in the aggregation, refinement, authentication, and distribution of datasets. 
The objective is to foster the development of authenticated and superior-quality datasets that are integral to the establishment of an Open Gen AI infrastructure tailored for India. 
This document articulates the guiding principles and operational blueprint for such an open-source endeavor, steered by the overarching guidelines stipulated by the parent (OpenGenAI charter)[../README.md].

## Tenets 
1. Comprehensive Inclusion: Emphasizing the importance of linguistic and cultural diversity, datasets must encapsulate a broad spectrum of Indian languages and dialects represented in various formats, including but not limited to audio, video, and text. This inclusivity ensures the GenAI systemâ€™s capability to understand and generate content that is reflective of India's rich cultural and linguistic heritage.

1. Data Integrity and Authentication: The process of dataset collection and curation is underpinned by rigorous verification mechanisms. These mechanisms are crucial for ensuring the authenticity and reliability of the data, thereby enhancing the quality of AI models trained on these datasets.

1. Privacy and Regulatory Compliance: In the collection and utilization of data, strict adherence to privacy laws is imperative. This involves ensuring that data acquisition respects individual rights and consent and that personal information is anonymized to prevent the identification of data subjects. The source and anonymization or masking approaches must be made transparent.

1. Open Access and Collaboration: The initiative advocates for open access to datasets, promoting a collaborative environment wherein researchers, developers, and AI enthusiasts can contribute to and benefit from the collective knowledge pool. This approach accelerates innovation and democratizes access to AI resources.

1. Quality Assurance and Continuous Improvement: Establishing protocols for ongoing quality assessment and enhancement of datasets is critical. This includes mechanisms for community feedback and periodic review to address inaccuracies, biases, or gaps in the data, ensuring that the datasets evolve in alignment with emerging needs and standards.

## Operational Framework 
The operational framework provides a set of frameworks, guidelines, and rules that govern the charter to meet the objective of this charter. 


1. Collection & Curation Framework: The strategy outlines a systematic approach for identifying, collecting, and organizing data from diverse sources. This encompasses both structured and unstructured data, ensuring a comprehensive repository that supports a wide array of AI applications.

1. Verification: Detailed processes for data verification and validation are essential to maintain the integrity of datasets. This involves both automated and manual review processes to verify the accuracy, relevance, and authenticity of the data collected.

1. Data Anonymization and Security Protocols: Given the paramount importance of privacy and security, the document specifies stringent data anonymization techniques and security protocols. These measures are designed to protect sensitive information and comply with applicable data protection regulations.

1. Framework for Open Access and Distribution: The operational blueprint includes guidelines for the open distribution of datasets. It delineates the licensing arrangements, access protocols, and distribution channels, ensuring that datasets are accessible to a wide audience while respecting copyright and intellectual property laws.

1. Community Engagement and Contribution Model: A structured model for community engagement and contributions is vital for the sustainability and growth of the dataset repository. This model encourages active participation from a diverse group of stakeholders, including academia, industry, and the developer community, fostering a collaborative ecosystem for AI innovation.
