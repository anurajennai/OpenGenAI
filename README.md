# OpenGenAI
Community Collaboration on datasets, standards, apis, hardware and policy for creating an open source Gen AI stack for  India and the developing world

Introduction

In an era where generative AI technologies like large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models are rapidly advancing, there is a growing concern about the monopolization of these technologies by the developed world. This monopolization risks depriving vast populations in the developing world, including India, of the significant benefits these technologies can offer. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive charter for open source collaboration on generative AI, specifically tailored to the needs of India and other developing nations. This charter aims to democratize access to AI technologies, ensuring their development and usage are inclusive, equitable, and beneficial to all.

Charter

1. Open Source development of India-Specific Datasets: Prioritize the creation and open sourcing of comprehensive datasets relevant to India and similar economies. These datasets will cover diverse languages, cultural nuances, and local knowledge, crucial for training AI models that are truly representative of the developing world.

2. Open Source Design and Standards for Generative AI Models: Establish and share open standards and designs for generative AI models. This will include guidelines for ethical AI development, ensuring these models are built with fairness, transparency, and accountability at their core.

3. Open Source Collaboration for Developing/Customizing India and Developing World Specific LLMs and Diffusion Models: Foster a collaborative environment for the development and customization of LLMs and diffusion models that cater to the unique challenges and requirements of the developing world, with a focus on scalability, local language support, and contextual relevance.

4. Open APIs for Interacting with Generative AI Models: Develop and maintain open APIs that provide easy and equitable access to generative AI technologies. These APIs will be instrumental in integrating AI capabilities into various applications and services relevant to the developing world.

5. Open Source Collaboration to Develop Custom AI Chips and Hardware: Engage in collaborative efforts to design and manufacture AI chips and hardware optimized for the resource constraints typical in developing countries. This approach aims to reduce dependencies on expensive, imported technology and promote self-reliance.

6. Open Collaboration Standards for Sharing and Federating Infrastructure for Generative AI Training and Execution: Establish standards and protocols for sharing and federating computational resources and infrastructure. This initiative will enable resource-pooling for AI training and execution, making these technologies more accessible.

7. Open Collaboration to Generate Ideas and Implement Practical Applications of Generative AI: Create platforms and forums for brainstorming and implementing practical applications of generative AI in contexts relevant to India and the developing world. This includes addressing challenges in healthcare, education, agriculture, and local governance.

8. Inclusion of Policymakers, Academia, and General Populace: Actively involve policymakers, academic institutions, and the general public in these collaborative efforts. This inclusion will ensure the development of AI technologies is aligned with public policy, educational objectives, and the needs of the broader populace, fostering widespread adoption and understanding.
